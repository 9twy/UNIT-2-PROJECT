      <p class="pb-6 dark:text-[#b0b0b0]">also known as the Saudi Ardah, is a traditional folk dance performed during national occasions, festivals, and celebrations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It represents an important part of the Kingdom's history, as it originated as one of the war chants of the past. It is the official dance of the country, with the King also participating in official welcoming ceremonies for dignitaries.
        The Ardah Najdiyyah was inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2015. The performers wear a special attire, using drums and swords, and carrying the flag of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia..</p>

        <p class="pb-6 dark:text-[#b0b0b0]">
            Dr. Majeed Khan describes the ancient history of Arab dances, including the Ardah, stating that some of these dances today share common elements with the tribal art that dates back thousands of years. He notes that a large carved mural found in Jebel depicts masked men and women dancing, and these figures may represent mythological characters with human bodies and horse-like heads.

Interestingly, modern Arab men continue to practice a traditional group dance called the Ardah, which bears similarities to the rock art depictions found in Jebel, Maleehiya, Jinin, and Tabuk in northern Saudi Arabia. From the analysis of the ancient images, the way the dancers are grouped together, the positioning of their legs, arms, and hands (with each dancer holding the hand of another), and their synchronized movements, align with the way the tribal Ardah dance is performed today.

The discovered archaeological artifacts date back to the Late Stone Age, between around 10,000 to 7,500 years ago.

So in summary, the Ardah Najdiyyah dance has ancient roots stretching back thousands of years, with clear connections to the tribal arts and dance traditions of the Arabian Peninsula.

                    The Ardha (traditional sword dance) accompanied the stages of the establishment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its unification during the reign of King Abdulaziz Al Saud. It was a war dance and one of the chants performed during times of war. The people of Najd used to perform it after victory in battle, before the unification of the country, so it was called the "Najdi Ardha". It is considered a manifestation of martial enthusiasm, a sharpening of the determination of the warriors, and an expression of moral strength in times of peace and joyous occasions. It has two connotations - a martial, leaping one, and a peaceful, recreational, underlying one, with a spirit of enthusiasm and moral strength. It is an enthusiastic dance that expresses the spirit of heroism, enthusiasm, and masculinity. <br> It was the first omen of war and the gathering for it, as  it was performed before the war<br> to prepare the fighters for the atmosphere of the battle, and thus it recalls the days of war.

            At the 10th session of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage held in Namibia in December 2015, the Saudi Ardha was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) under the title "Ardha Najdiyyah - a folk dance, drumming, and poetic chanting from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia". This marked the first time the Kingdom entered the list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

        <p class="pb-6 dark:text-[#b0b0b0]">
            This Ardha is organized, its rows are arranged, and the poetry recited in it is monitored for its harmony with the Ardha. Men are assigned to this task. The announcement of the start of the Ardha is made by a person with a loud voice, who stands in the middle and is surrounded only by the drummers. His call was previously known as "Al-Muhawwibah" and was used to declare war. One of the most famous lines said in this call is:
          </p>
<blockquote class="block mt-1 mb-10 dark:text-[#b0b0b0]">"O Allah, the One besides whom there is no deity... O Supporter of His troops against aggression."</blockquote>
<p class="pb-6 dark:text-[#b0b0b0]">
All the participants in the Ardha respond to this call by rushing to the field carrying their swords and chanting "Bishir, Bishir" (Good tidings, good tidings). Then they line up, intertwining and interlocking their hands.

        <p class="pb-6 dark:text-[#b0b0b0]">
            The Reciter: He recites the sung poem to the participants, and is responsible for guiding them from one verse of the poem to the next. <br>

The Sword Performers: They are the ones who perform sword movements in organized lines. <br>

The Flag Bearer: He carries the green flag, which has an average length of 3 meters. He holds it with his left hand, placing the lower end on his neck, and participates in the lines of the sword performers. <br>

The Large Drummers: The drummers of the large "bass drums" have a fixed position in the back row, and they recite the first verse of the poem to initiate the start of the performance. <br>

The Small Drummers: The drummers of the smaller "triangle drums" have a fixed position in the front, and they begin drumming after the initial beats of the large drums. They can also participate in the performance in the middle of the Ardha field. <br>
